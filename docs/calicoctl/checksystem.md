## calicoctl checksystem commands

### calicoctl checksystem 
This command allows you to verify that your host system is configured correctly
for calicoctl to manage a Calico network.  The Calico network hosts must be 
configured to have specific networking modules loaded, such as iptables, 
ipsets support, and IP forwarding.  Calico checks for these modules in the  
`modules.dep` and `modules.builtin` files under `/lib/modules/<kernel>/`.

Running this command will only check for incompatibilities on the host it is 
run on.

Command syntax:

```
calicoctl checksystem

    --fix:  DEPRECATED - no longer fixes issues detected by checksystem
    --libnetwork  Check for the correct docker version for libnetwork deployments
```

Examples:

```
$ calicoctl checksystem
WARNING: Unable to detect the xt_set module. Load with `modprobe xt_set`
WARNING: Unable to detect the ipip module. Load with `modprobe ipip`

$ calicoctl checksystem --libnetwork

```
