## calicoctl status commands


### calicoctl status
This command allows you to view state information about the `calico/node` and 
the BGP peers of the Calico node.

This command shows:
 - State and uptime of `calico/node` container
 - BGP State for IPv4 and IPv6 peers
   - Peer address: Host address used as BGP peer IP to route to Calico workloads
   - Peer type: How the two BGP peers are connected, such as through a 
   `node-to-node mesh`, a direct peer between two nodes as `node-specific`, 
   or as a `global` BGP peer (See the [`calicoctl bgp` reference](./bgp.md) for 
   more info)
   - State: Peer instance state, `up` or `down`
   - Since: How long the peer has been up
   - Info: BGP connection state, such as Established


Command syntax:

```
calicoctl status

```
