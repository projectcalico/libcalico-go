# libcalico-go
This repositiory contains Calico's Go components:

- `libcalico`, which can be imported as `"github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/lib"`

This library is used by:
  - [calicoctl](https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl)
  - [Calico CNI plugin](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-cni)
  - [Calico libnetwork plugin](https://github.com/projectcalico/libnetwork-plugin)
  - [felix](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix).

If you wish to use libcalico for integration with Calico networking and
policy, the main entry point to managing Calico configuration is through
the client.

-  Documentation for the client is in [lib/client GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/lib/client).
-  The resource structure definitions are defined in [lib/api](https://godoc.org/github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/lib/api), this
   includes detailed per-resource and per-field level descriptions.
-  Resource definitions can be found in [Calico docs](http://docs.projectcalico.org/master/reference/calicoctl/resources/)
-  This repository also includes the implementation for Calico IPAM which can be found in `lib/client`
